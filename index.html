<h2>This is the main page for computer architecture</h2>
some terms and components commonly exist in computer structure and mentioned by computer architects,knowing this components will make the user understand the function for each of them
<h2>Computer Case:</h2>
Its a box includes wires and the tiny components. it is considered as the skeletal system of computer.it keeps the components and the chips safe and they are attached to it and prevent over heating,it is not neccessary to buy an expensive one as long as it keeps the components safe and tightly attached.
<h2>Motherboards:</h2>
<h4>Considered as the logic board, its function to make all computer components connected together and it uses the printed circute boared in order to make every thing centered. it contains hard drives for storage, ram, cpu and gpu,all ports attached together or by specialised cables that connected to mother board.When the cable or usb is insrted in, it is directely connected to the computer the price of mother board varies according to the demands will be needed and it is advisable to get the motherboard which contains all types of ports in the past the sound card was separated and it was neccessary for playing the audio so it was sold individualy but now it is integrated to the motherboard</h4> 
<h2>Cpu</h2>
It is the most important componant in the computer system and it is considered the brain of the computer it is the abreviation of centeral processing unit.Its function is to take the instructions and the process them and processing the logic operation then storing them. today the computers contains two or more cpu to increase the ability for processing and when the computer contains more cpu the performance will increase like transfering files  the common cpu corporations are amd and intel . there is a term called(dual-core) simply it means two cpu, and it up to you to choose which cpu you will need according to the demands. Generally the best cpu which cmputers have will perform tasks fast such like photo or video editing or gaming
<h2>Power Supply</h2> 
Any system needs the energy in order to work such like the creatures which need food which provides them with the energy needed,the computer system has the same idea and its food representated in form of power supply, its main function is providing the computer with the electric power to perform tasks and its can be abreviated to(psu) and it converts the AC current into DC current. it is advisable to get power supply with high efficency to ensure that all the components work efficiently and to provide them with boost energy to improve the performance of tasking
<h2>Ram</h2>
Its the abreviation of (random access memory),the architects associate the computer speed with capacity of ram but what is the reason?simply it is the same idea for the human,when humans brain can remember the facts and the moments from his memory quickly it will mke him to respond better,meanwhile in the computer it process the data in the memory so it has  the ability for transfering the files and documents and the capacity of this memory has a great effect when the capacity of the ram increase the ability for running the programs increase.suppose that memory recalling of the human has a limit this will be a problem as the human will not respond to the moments and facts quichkly.the same thing in computer system when it has wnough memory it would be able to run more than one program easily at same time.
<h2>Hard drive</h2>
During performing the tasks and editing the documents like using word document it will be neccessary to store them so the hard drive can perform this task.Its called the peremenant memory and when the power is shut off or the current is cut suddenly the documents and files remains exist in folder destination.This kind of memory includes different types of files and programes the capacity needed for this memory depends on the demands for the user And intuitive more the capacity that hard include And obviously, the more space, the greater the storage capacity for storing the documents. 
<h2>Optical Drives</h2>
its the driver where the cd and dvd drivers placed, its function to read and write the data in the discs that can be removed.There is a new technology for movies called Blue-Ray readers but as this memory can be removed it become obsolete due to the existance of USB, from the features of usb drive not only easy to handle but its also cheap.
