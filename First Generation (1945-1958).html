<h2>Features</h2>
<h4>-empty tubes</h4>
<h4>-coding machine,assembly language</h4>
<h4>-the computers include centeral processor which make the computer unique</h4>
<h4>-variety in the supported instructions</h4>
<h4>-usage of the magnetic memory or the drum memory,the programs and the data are loaded through using the loaded paper tape or punch cards</h4>

<h3>ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator)</h3>
bulit by J.Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert in 1943-46.Its the first electronic computer it can does 5000 additions and 357 multiplications per second, its very fast in calculations, the dimensions of the numerical word is 10 decimal digits,its aim to make calculations for ballistic shells during WWII,this machine was programed through setting switches,inserted and uninserted cables.There is 18,000 tubes used,weighted30 tones and consumption of electrical power reaches 160kilowatts.

<h3>Whirlwind computer</h3>
The machine was built in 1949 by Jay Forrester.This computer was built through 500 empty tubes and magnetic core memory

<h3>Universal Automatic Computer</h3>
It can be abreviated in UNIVAC.Eckert and Mauchly were built this computer in 1951 and it was the first commerical computer its cost was about 1 million dolar.had an add time of 120 microseconds, multiply time of1,800 microseconds and a divide time of 3,600 microseconds, usedmagnetic tape as input
<h3>IBM's 701</h3>
This computer charecterized by the electrostatic memory and it was the first successful commerical purpose computer, its also contains magnetic tape and to store the informations and single hardware
