<h2>second generation(1958-1964)</h2>
<h3>features<h3>
<h4>-contains transistors which charecterized by the low in cost,power</h4>
<h4>-includes magnetic core memeory</h4>
<h4>-Two's complement, floating point arithmetic</h4>
<h4>-the computation reduced from milisecond to microsecond</h4>
<h4>-includes high level language</h4>
<h4>-First operating Systems: handled one program at a time</h4>
<h4>-1959 - IBM´s 7000 series mainframes were the company´s first</h4>
<h4>-transistorized computers</h4>
<h3>IBM 7090<h3>
<h4>At that time this computer system was the best powerful for processing the data.The fullytransistorized system its computing speed is faster than the  those of its vacuum-tube predecessor 6 times,the IBM 709.despite the  IBM 7090 was being general purpose for processing data, its formed with specfic attention to the needs of the design of missiles, jet engines, nuclear reactors and supersonic aircraft.Includes many transistors(reachs to 50,000 transistors)and magnetic core memory.New system has the ability for writing by rate 3,000,000 bits per second, when 8 data chanels are in use.It can locate and get ready for usage of 32,768 data in the magnetic memory in 2,18 millions of second. In one second this system can process many operations  like  229,000 additions or subtractions, 39,500 multiplications, or 32,700 divisions.<h4>
